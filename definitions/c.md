### Class
In object-oriented programming, a class is a template definition of the methods, variables, and constants in a particular kind of [object](./o.md#object).

### Code Review
When one developer reviews the code of another and gives feedback on it. This happens more often on [pull requests](./p.md#pull-request) and is essential for the growth of both developers.

### Constant
A named identifier for specific data within a program. The data contained within the constant **will not** change during the programâ€™s lifecycle. The variable may also have a data type, which denotes what type of data is stored within the variable.
```
static final Integer MY_CONSTANT_INTEGER = 200;
```
