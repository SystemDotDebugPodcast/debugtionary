### Flow Control
The order in which individual statements, [methods](./m.md#method), or functions of an application are executed or evaluated.

### For Loop
A very specific type of flow control which allows a programmer to control the number of times a particular line of code is executed. The example below adds all of the numbers from 0 to 10.
```
Integer sum = 0;
for(Integer i=0; i<=10; i++) {
  sum = sum + i;
}
```

### Framework
A collection of programs and/or applications that are the foundation that developers use to build their own programs and applications on. A great example of this is the popular JavaScript framework [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).

### Functional Programming
The process of building software by creating pure, composable functions that have no shared state, mutable data, or side effects. Functional Programming is declarative rather than imperative.
