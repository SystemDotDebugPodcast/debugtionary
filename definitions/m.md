### Master Branch
The main branch in any [repository](./r.md#repository) from which production builds of the application or program are generated.

### Method
An action that an [object](./o.md#object) or [class](./c.md#class) is able to perform. An example of this is a **dog** class with a method called **bark**.
```
public class dog {
  private string name;
  public dog(string name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  
  public string bark() {
    return "woof!";
  }
}
```

### Microservice Architecture
A method of developing software applications as a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services in which each service runs a unique process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism to serve a business goal. The opposite of a [monolith](./m.md#monolithic-architecture).

### Monolithic Architecture
A method of developing software applications in which functionally distinguishable aspects (for example data input and output, data processing, error handling, and the user interface) are all interwoven, rather than containing architecturally separate components. The opposite of a [microservice](./m.md#microservice-architecture).
